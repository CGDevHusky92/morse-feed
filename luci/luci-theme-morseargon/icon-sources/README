These are generated by fantasticon:

e.g.

    npm install -g fantasticon
    fantasticon

If you want to add another icon, copy the icon to the icons folder
and rerun fantasticon.

Currently, these are all boostrap icons (see ../LICENSE.bootstrap-icons).
Why don't we just use the bootstrap icons woff file? Because that's over
100kb compressed, and we want to avoid using up space unnecessarily.
