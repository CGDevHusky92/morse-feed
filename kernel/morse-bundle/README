This package contains a number of configuration defaults and scripts
used by the MorseMicro EVKs. It is a bit of a non-kosher package to
centralise sometimes necessarily deployed components which don't yet
have a formal home.

The longer term plan is for this package to disappear, as users
of the SDK should be able to pick and choose which functionality
they want without EVK specific configuration leaking in.
